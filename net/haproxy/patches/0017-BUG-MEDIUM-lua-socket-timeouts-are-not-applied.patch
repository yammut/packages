    BUG/MEDIUM: lua: socket timeouts are not applied
    
    Sachin Shetty reported that socket timeouts set in LUA code have no effect.
    Indeed, connect timeout is never modified and is always set to its default,
    set to 5 seconds. Currently, this patch will apply the specified timeout
    value to the connect timeout.
    For the read and write timeouts, the issue is that the timeout is updated but
    the expiration dates were not updated.
    
    This patch should be backported up to the 1.6 branch.
